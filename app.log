The explosions resulted in the deaths of three people and injuries to hundreds, including some who lost limbs. The Tsarnaev brothers were later identified as the suspects in the bombing, leading to a series of events including a shootout with police in Watertown, where Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokhar was eventually captured.\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing included an unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, during which residents were asked to stay indoors and businesses and public places were closed. Dzhokhar was eventually found hiding in a boat in a Watertown resident's backyard and taken into custody. During questioning, he revealed that he and his brother were motivated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, self-radicalized, and had learned to build explosive devices from an online magazine of al-Qaeda.\n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted of multiple charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, and initially sentenced to death. However, the sentence was later vacated and reinstated by the Supreme Court. The Boston Marathon Bombing was a tragic event that shook the city of Boston and the nation as a whole, highlighting the impact of domestic terrorism and the resilience of the community in the face of such acts of violence.")]

The aftermath of these attacks led to a global condemnation of terrorism, with world leaders, political and religious representatives, and the international media expressing solidarity with the United States and calling for justice against the perpetrators.\n\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration declared a war on terrorism, aiming to bring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and prevent the emergence of other terrorist networks. This declaration led to various measures, including economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists and increased global surveillance and intelligence sharing. The attacks also had implications for U.S. foreign policy, contributing to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the overthrow of the Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\n\nThe attacks prompted a strong response from different communities in the United States. Muslim Americans, through various organizations, condemned the acts of terrorism and called for the swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. President George W.
